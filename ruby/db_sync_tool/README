Introduction
------------

The simple ruby script is used for copying Nebutown database files to multiple 
directories (even on different machines in the LAN). This is not a powerful tool 
with features such as fault tolerence and atomic operations, it simply saves you 
a lot of keystrokes of doing a lot of cp/scp and zip/unzip.


How to use 
----------

1. Copy the db_sync_tool.rb to one of your directory which contains nebutown
    databases ( dbcore/ and dbmedia/ )

2. Modify the configuraion fields in the script : 
    add the paths you want the db to be copied to in the list
    (use IP:FULL_PATH notation, and you must include current dir) 

3. Run the script :
    ./db_sync_tool.rb <name_of_the_tarball>

4. Check the results :
    if no error reports, then the operation is success
    (if one operation fails then the script will fail, note that files already copied
    before the failure will not be rollback)


What it does behind
-------------------

It simply tar & gzip the specified files and cp/scp to the dir based on the location 
type (local or remote).
